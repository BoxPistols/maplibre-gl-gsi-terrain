description: Run all tests (unit, modules, e2e)
---

Run the complete test suite including unit tests, module tests, and end-to-end tests:

```bash
pnpm test:all
```

This will run:
1. Unit tests with coverage
2. Module tests with coverage
3. Playwright e2e tests

If any tests fail, analyze the failures and suggest fixes.
